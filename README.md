- Chunks and chunk buffer
- Runtime terrain teneration (with features that can span multiple chunks)
- Multithreaded
- Built on Java and LWJGL (openGL library)
- Intersection handling
- Automatic remove hidden surfaces
- Particles
- Grappling hook & Jet pack & Wall climbing
- Light
- Infinite world size
- Sound effects and background music
- Skybox
- Motino blur
- Draw cull
- Voxel based engine with support for non-axis-oriented convex polygons
- Map editor with custom build UI framework

This is not meant for pretty rendering, it is meant for optimizing rendering algorithms and combining multiple rendering approaches in order to support more than simple voxel cubes while inheriting voxel engines' performance capabilities and vast dynamic world support.
